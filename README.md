ActMap is a simple utility for converting json based social media feeds feeds to the activity stream format conformant with the activity strema json schema as
 defined by https://github.com/activitystreams/json-schema/blob/master/activity.json
 Each Entry in the actMap schema defines a set of rules which are activity templates that can be exppanded to produce compliant activity objects when matched
 against items in the feeds to which they apply.
 Simple Twitter and Facebook exmaples are included here, but more will be added soon
